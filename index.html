    <h4>My Hobby: Music</h4>
    <p>I really enjoy pop music. I also prefer R and B music. When I listen to music it's like a travel to a different world thats full of music. It's like my getaway place. I really enjoy listening to "Save Your Tears" by The Weeknd. I also enjoy listening to "rubberband" by Tate McRae. One of my favorite singers is Ariana Grande, she is really an amazing singer.</p>
